# Classification of Breast Cancer Images
An image classifier to classify whether the image is Inductive Ductal Carcinoma(IDC) type of breast cancer or not

# Aim and objectives of  project 
The aim of this project would be to develop an image classifier to classify whether the image is Inductive Ductal Carcinoma(IDC) type of cancer or not. IDC is a common type of breast cancer that begins growing in a milk duct and invades the fibrous or fatty tissue of the breast outside of the duct. The CNN would be trained on breast histopathology images and will be used to classify whether the person is suffering from IDC type of breast cancer or not.

# Motivation
Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common phenotypic subtype of all Breast cancers (BCa) comprising nearly 80% of them. Breast cancer affecting women is known as high mortality unless diagnosed in time.  A study published by NVIDIA showed that deep learning drops error rate for breast cancer diagnoses by 85%.  So, our prime target is to classify whether the image has IDC type of breast cancer or not because it would help in automatic and early detection of breast cancer which can be helpful for complete removal of the cancer.
